# Transport Data Analysis: Vehicles and Fuel Efficiency

## Overview
This project is part of a data analysis assignment focused on transport, particularly analyzing vehicles and fuel efficiency. The goal of the project is to use the dataset provided to generate visualizations that will later inform AI-based models for improving transport systems. The visualizations created for this project include a histogram of fuel efficiency and a correlation heatmap of various features.

## Assignment Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transport-related data (vehicles and fuel efficiency).
- Visualize relationships between different features using a histogram and a heatmap.
- Correctly interpret the diagrams to understand the dataset.
- Export the resulting diagrams and notebook for submission.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to vehicles and their fuel efficiency. The key features analyzed include:
- **Vehicle Fuel Efficiency**: The efficiency of vehicles in terms of fuel usage.
- **Other Vehicle Attributes**: Various other features that may influence fuel efficiency (e.g., vehicle weight, engine size).

## Steps Performed

### 1. Import Libraries
The following Python libraries were used:
- `pandas`: For data loading and manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For basic plotting.
- `seaborn`: For advanced visualizations, including heatmaps and histograms.

### 2. Data Loading
The dataset was imported using the `pandas` library and displayed to ensure correct loading. A subset of the data (6 rows) was shown to understand its structure.

### 3. Visualizations
#### a. Histogram
A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of the fuel efficiency values. The distribution helps to identify the most common fuel efficiency ranges among the vehicles.

#### b. Heatmap
A correlation heatmap was generated to visualize the relationships between different numerical features in the dataset. This heatmap helps to identify which factors are positively or negatively correlated with fuel efficiency.

### 4. Interpretation
The visualizations were interpreted in a notebook cell to explain the relationships observed between different features.

## Files Included
- `transport_analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and visualizations.
- `fuel_efficiency_histogram.png`: PNG file of the fuel efficiency histogram.
- `feature_correlation_heatmap.png`: PNG file of the correlation heatmap.
- `README.md`: This README file explaining the project.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`transport_analysis.ipynb`) using Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells to load the dataset, generate visualizations, and view the outputs.

## Conclusion
This project provided insight into the transport dataset, particularly regarding vehicle fuel efficiency. The histogram revealed the distribution of fuel efficiency, and the heatmap highlighted correlations between various features. These insights will help inform future AI models that aim to optimize transport systems.
